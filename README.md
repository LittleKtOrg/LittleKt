### Acknowledgements
LittleKt was put together based on bits and pieces of features found across multiple engines/frameworks and languages that were very enjoyable to use and flexible. If a piece a code looks familiar, feel free to open an issue with details, so that we can properly attribute the code.

A big thanks to the folks over on libGDX, KorGE, and MiniGDX.

The very popular and amazing [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) which is the main inspiration of this framework.

Carlos Velasco's (soywiz) awesome Kotlin game engine [KorGE](https://github.com/korlibs/korge) which has a bunch of very enjoyable features and awesome ideas that were brought over to be used in LittleKt.

David Wursteisen's excellent multiplatform game framework [MiniGDX](https://github.com/minigdx/minigdx/) that allowed LittleKt to get up and running quickly.
